#About Tweeparator
Tweeparator is a Python project that I'm working on that uses Tweepy to send out tweets. So what's so great about it??
Good question!!! If you have a longggg text to be tweeted, you'll have to break it down into pieces and tweet it one after another right? Not anymore!!
Just pass the text file to Tweeparator and you're all set!!

Tweeparator will be using
	1. Tweepy
	2. NLTK

In future I plan to make it smart so as to identify the context and break down your text into tweets that are not just the parts of tweet, but have some meaning to them.
